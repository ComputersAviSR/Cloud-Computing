# Sample Architectures for Learning Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing various sample architectures that I've created for learning purposes. These architectures demonstrate the integration of AWS services to solve common business problems.

## Overview

Each architecture example provides a detailed breakdown of how different AWS services can be integrated to address specific business challenges. Explore these architectures to gain insights into:

- AWS service usage and integration patterns
- Best practices for designing scalable and resilient solutions
- Real-world scenarios and use cases

## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scripts

(Work in Progress) ðŸš§ In addition to these architectures, I'll also be providing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts using AWS CloudFormation and HashiCorp Terraform. These scripts enable the automated provisioning and management of the architectures showcased here.

Feel free to explore each architecture folder for detailed diagrams, code samples, and deployment instructions and correct me / suggest any improvements required.
